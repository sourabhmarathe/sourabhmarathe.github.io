## Welcome

I use this blog to provide professional updates, write about my interests (currently: software and search funds) and share content that I find interesting.

## Biography

I am studying for an MBA at Columbia Business School. Prior to business school, I worked as a software engineer in domains ranging from embedded systems to mobile app development. More recently, I've taken an interest in the world of entrepreneurship through acquisition. My hope is to integrate my past experience in software development with the world of entrepreneurship through acquisition to help grow a software firm to its fullest potential.
