Lessons from Richard Harris, a sales consultant, who came to speak with us about how he views the future of sales.

- Everyone is selling something... you might as well get good at it.
- Soft skills are becoming more important at the margin (relative to hard skills)
- Target the biggest skeptic; (more: this is due to the world becoming more complicated, and decisions are becoming based on committees.)

It was very interesting to hear about the effect of technology on sales. Most notably, the process is becoming increasingly analytical and "operationalized" in the sense that it requires much more support and has much more potential for optimization.
