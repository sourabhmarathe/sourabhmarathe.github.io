I want to share a [video](https://youtu.be/TD5tkpOoDVs?si=S2nCBEczk_DjcLVz) from my peer at Northeastern, [Rashid Khamis](https://twitter.com/the2hourman).

Rashid has very useful thoughts on productivity, the human body and how to make the most out of one's life. Definitely worth checking out some of his content.
