[Robert Caro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Caro) is the author of "The Years of Lyndon Johnson", a series on the life of the 36th President of the United States. Caro uses the biography of LBJ to explore human nature and understand how political power manifests. 

Importantly, by highlighting the most striking manifestations of power, Caro guides readers to understand how politics and power shapes people's lives in invisible ways.

Caro also highlights common attributes in the personalities of those that rise to power: ambition, grit and energy combine to drive great people to shape the world.

The books are long, and this blog post provides a [great introduction](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/lyndon-johnson) to the series and author himself.
