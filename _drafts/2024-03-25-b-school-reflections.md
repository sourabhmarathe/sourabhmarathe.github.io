I am now one year into the MBA program at Columbia Business School. It's been a great experience meeting interesting people, developing new skills, and exploring career options.

As the first year comes to an end, I thought it would be interesting to share a few surprising things I learned while at school.

## Advice for Next Year's Class

First, as soon as possible, set a goal for what you want to do over the summer and prioritize achieving that goal. Until every option is slammed shut, pursue the goal.

Second, the trips and parties are not that important. While it's widely known that trips and parties play a large role in the culture of business school, you can basically ignore that stuff.

This might be the most important point! People want to talk with you and hear what you are thinking about. Articulate a message with structure and concision and go find the right people to talk to.

Lastly, develop comfort with asking for things. Ask for 10% off on coffee. Ask for a resume review. Ask people if they'd like to grab a meal. And ask even when it feels a bit uncomfortable.

### Concluding Thoughts

Business school has been a fascinating experience. It has pushed me well outside of my comfort zone and I've learned a lot in my first year.

Overall, I'm very grateful for the people I've met and the opportunity to explore what to do next with my career.
