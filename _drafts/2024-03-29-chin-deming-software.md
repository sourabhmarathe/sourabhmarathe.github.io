This [tweet](https://x.com/ejames_c/status/1771812779621585282?s=20) introduced me to another perspective towards software: what are the downstream effects of the marginal costs of distribution and development being so low? And how is it useful to compare software development to manufacturing operations?

Software:

A few reasons why software engineers can hide behind inefficiencies:

- zero-to-no costs to develop or distribute at the margin
- long-term technical debt costs are unclear
- high margins provide cover to sub-optimal decision making

Furthermore, software engineers accrue all sorts of intangible knowledge about how to interact with the codebase. In turn, this leads to a lack of separation between the engineers and the product itself, leading to further challenges for anyone looking to address the technical debt.

In the long-term, this probably means that there is a lot of old software out there that needs to be refreshed and can be acquired at a deep discount... What's needed is someone to come in and be willing to address the technical issues that have built up over time.
