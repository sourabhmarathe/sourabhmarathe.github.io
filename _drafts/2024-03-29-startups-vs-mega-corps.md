One of the most interesting experiences I had in my career was working at two software contracting firms: Raytheon, a large defense contractor, and The Routing Company, an MIT focused on public transit. Both companies had one thing in common: a sales cycle driven by contracts signed with public sector clients. As a result, experiencing both workplaces gave me some insight into how scale and culture shapes organizations.

One key lesson I got from this was that at the end of the day, the operation of developing software is downstream of the company's long-term strategic objectives and clientele. At Raytheon, I could see how the main client (Department of Defense) had a large effect on the firm's working culture and led to a very manufacturing like operation. Conversely, The Routing Company had few clients, and more of its culture came from its founding partners, two software engineers. In turn, this led to a culture much more positive towards exploring new tech and taking risks on building new systems.

Furthermore, the industry that firms operated in strongly affected the pace of development. At Raytheon, contracts were long-term, required strict adherence to security protocols and involved updating technology that developed over years. As a result, the skillset that was required to perform was completely different from that of The Routing Company, where new product development and the ability to find new tooling to solve problems was much more valuable.

In terms of the difficulty of the work, both companies were still performing very hard work at the senior most levels. At Raytheon, Principal and Staff-level engineers are very competent and talented, and it shows in how they are able to divvy up work for less experienced colleagues to contribute towards. Conversely, at The Routing Company, work was highly entrepreneurial; the challenges was not only the scale of the work, but also in the initiative that engineers needed to take in order to do well.

Overall, it was fascinating to see how two contractors providing software to the government could rely on such vastly different skillsets, cultures, and organizational systems to thrive. It goes to show that when one evaluates the merits of an organization, one cannot only look at the codebase or the talent level of individuals to assess the difficulty of what they are doing.
